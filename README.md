# RecursiveMazeSolver

This was the first project for my Data Structures and Algorithms class. It involved attempting to solve a given maze using recursive methods. This was not originally on GitHub, as the instructor at the time had us email the .cpp file to him instead. The maze.in file is an example maze that can be tested if one wishes to, or you can make your own maze and test if it works. It hopefully should!

If you do decide to create a maze, you may need to change the name of the file that the program is looking for or just edit the already existing maze.in file. The syntax for the maze.in is as follows:
<pre>
{Number of Rows} {Number of Columns}
{maze}
<\pre>
The maze must start at (0,0) and end at (Number of Rows, Number of Columns). A path is labeled by a '.' and a wall is labeled by a '*'. The pathing cannot be at a diagonal. Finally, the max amount of rows and columns is 10.
